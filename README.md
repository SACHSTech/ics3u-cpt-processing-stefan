## Objective 
Our game will be our version of the classic game [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). The premise of the game is to be able to destroy all the enemy space invaders while dodging their attacks and maintaining up to 3 lives. The game will have user input that includes mouse clicks to start the game and arrow keys to control your ship. Players will be able to obtain power ups to enhance their ship and make it easier to progress through the duration of the game. 

## Mechanics
Mouse will be needed to start the game as well as your A, D, left arrow and right arrow keys to move your ship during the game. Keyboard input will determine where the ship moves, altering where the ship shoots and how it will dodge enemy shots. 

## Scoring
Scoring is tallied on how many enemy space invaders you destory. The more you destroy, the higher the score goes up per space invader destroyed. A bonus is also awarded for each fleet of space invaders you defeat.
